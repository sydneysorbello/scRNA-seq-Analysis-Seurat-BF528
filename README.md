# scRNA-seq-Analysis-Seurat-BF528
This repository stores the code for a scRNA-seq pipeline built to complete a final project for Boston University's course BF528. The pipeline includes quality control, pre-processing, and seurat workflow for single cell analysis. Additionally, the workflow featues single cell cluster annotation using both automated and manual methods. 

The data used for this project was pulled from the publiation 'Identification of distinct tumor cell populations and key genetic mechanisms through single cell sequencing in hepatoblastoma' produced by Bondoc et. al. (Bondoc et. al., 2021). 

Two figures were reproduced from the intial paper in order to validate the pieplines results. Figure 3b was reproduced from the paper and stored in this repository as 'marker_umap_grid.png'. It is important to note that the figure is not an exact carbon copy from the original paper, but this is expected as the workflow analysis are different. Additionally, the figure produced by this workflow matches expression patterns of the biomarkers in respective cell types.
